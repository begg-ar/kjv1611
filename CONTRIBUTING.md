This font is made with FontForge. You will also need `ttx` and `sfnt2woff` to do a complete build.

When it comes to advanced typographical features, FontForge's UI is rarely conducive to implementing them. Therefore we use feature files and scripts for all advanced typography.

You can build from the development SFD file using `build.sh`.
